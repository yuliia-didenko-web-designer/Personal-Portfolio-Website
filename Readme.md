# Yuliia Didenko Portfolio


## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, as a passionate UI/UX designer. The website showcases my professional journey, design projects, creative approach, and provides an interactive way for visitors to connect with me through a drawing canvas and contact form. The site combines modernative design elements, responsive layouts, and engaging animations to reflect my expertise in creating user-centered digital experiences.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: Used for designing the wireframes and illustrations of the portfolio website, ensuring a user-centered and visually cohesive experience.
- **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsive design (includes media queries and CSS Grid).
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, including:
  - Custom cursor effects (`cursor.js`).
  - Responsive navigation with a burger menu (`navigation.js`).
  - Interactive drawing canvas with color and line width controls (`canvas.js`).
- **SVG Animations**: For the hero section’s dynamic visual effects.
- **Bootstrap 4.5.2**: For additional styling and responsive utilities.
- **Fonts**: Custom fonts (Tan Pearl, MabryPro) for a unique typographic style.
- **External APIs**: Spotify iframe for music integration.


## Future Improvements

- **Replace the SVG animation** in the hero section with a video that triggers via JavaScript, playing on page load, pausing when the user scrolls down past the viewport, and resuming when the user scrolls back to the hero section.

- **Optimize the grid column layout** for tablets and mobile devices, moving away from the current 12-column setup to a more tailored structure for each device type.

- **Enhance the interactive canvas** by adding functionality for stickers and text input, allowing users to create more complex and personalized artwork.

- **Add new projects to the portfolio** as they become available, ensuring the site remains up-to-date with the latest work.

- **Redesign the burger menu** with a more creative and animated style to enhance the mobile navigation experience.

- **Add form submission functionality** with a backend (e.g., Node.js or a serverless function).

- **Add accessibility features** (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).

- **Animate SVGs on my Approach screen** to make the screen more engaging and illustrative.
